    üöÄ **Job Search with Mode-Specific Processing**
    
    This endpoint adapts its behavior based on the current application mode:
    
    **üöÄ LIGHTWEIGHT MODE:**
    - Simple keyword-based search
    - No ML processing or vector embeddings
    - Fast response times with basic filtering
    
    **üß† FULL ML MODE:**
    - Local semantic vector search with sentence transformers
    - Cross-encoder reranking for improved relevance
    - Two-stage search: broad retrieval + precise reranking
    
    **‚òÅÔ∏è CLOUD ML MODE:**
    - HuggingFace Inference API for embeddings
    - Automatic fallback to local models if cloud fails
    - Cross-encoder reranking with detailed health monitoring
    
    **‚ú® Common Features:**
    - **Smart filtering** - Location, skills, keyword exclusions
    - **Relevance boosting** - Preferred skills increase scores  
    - **Intelligent caching** - Fast repeat queries
    - **Health monitoring** - Component status tracking
